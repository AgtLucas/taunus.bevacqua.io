In fact, it might be a good idea for you to **set up just the server-side aspect first**, as that'll teach you how it works even when JavaScript never gets to the client.\n\n    # How It works\n\n    Taunus follows a simple but **proven** set of rules.\n\n    - Define a `function(model)` for each your views\n    - Put these views in both the server and the client\n    - Define routes for your application\n    - Put those routes in both the server and the client\n    - Ensure route matches work the same way on both ends\n    - Create server-side controllers that yield the model for your views\n    - Create client-side controllers if you need to add client-side functionality to a particular view\n    - For the first request, always render views on the server-side\n    - When rendering a view on the server-side, include the full layout as well!\n    - Once the client-side code kicks in, **hijack link clicks** and make AJAX requests instead\n    - When you get the JSON model back, render views on the client-side\n    - If the `history` API is unavailable, fall back to good old request-response. **Don't confuse your humans with obscure hash routers!**\n\n    # Installing Taunus\n\n    First off, you'll need to choose a HTTP server framework for your application. At the moment Taunus supports only a couple of HTTP frameworks, but more may be added if they are popular enough.\n\n    - [Express][6], through [taunus-express][1]\n    - [Hapi][7], through [taunus-hapi][2] and the [hapiify][3] transform\n\n    > If you're more of a _\"rummage through someone else's code\"_ type of developer, you may feel comfortable [going through this website's source code][4], which uses the [Hapi][7] flavor of Taunus. Alternatively you can look at the source code for [ponyfoo.com][5], which is **a more advanced use-case** under the [Express][6] flavor. Or, you could just keep on reading this page, that's okay too.\n\n    Once you've settled for either [Express][6] or [Hapi][7] you'll be able to proceed. For the purposes of this guide, we'll use [Express][6]. Switching between one of the different HTTP flavors is strikingly easy, though.\n\n    Naturally, you'll need to install all of the following modules from `npm` to get started.\n\n    ```shell\n    npm install taunus taunus-express express --save\n    ```\n\n    Let's build our application step-by-step, and I'll walk you through them as we go along. First of all, you'll need the famous `app.js` file.\n\n    ```shell\n    touch app.js\n    ```\n\n    It's probably a good idea to put something in your `app.js` file, let's do that now.\n\n    ```js\n    'use strict';\n\n    var taunus = require('taunus');\n    var taunusExpress = require('taunus-express');\n    var express = require('express');\n    var app = express();\n    var options = {};\n\n    taunusExpress(taunus, app, options);\n    app.listen(3000);\n    ```\n\n    All that `taunus-express` really does is add a bunch of routes to your Express `app`. You should note that any middleware and API routes should probably come before the `taunusExpress` invocation. You'll probably be using a catch-all view route that renders a _\"Not Found\"_ view, blocking any routing beyond that route.\n\n    The `options` object passed to `taunusExpress` let's you configure Taunus. Instead of discussing every single configuration option you could set here, let's discuss what matters: the _required configuration_. There's two options that you must set if you want your Taunus application to make any sense.\n\n    - `routes`, an array of view routes\n    - `layout`, a function that takes a single `model` argument and returns an entire HTML document\n\n    Routes need to be placed in its own dedicated module, so that you can reuse it later on **when setting up client-side routing**. Let's create that module and add a route to it.\n\n    ```shell\n    touch routes.js\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    'use strict';\n\n    module.exports = [\n      { route: '/', action: 'home/index' }\n    ];\n    ```\n\n    Each item in the exported array is a route. In this case, we only have the `/` route with the `home/index` action. Taunus follows the well known [convention over configuration pattern][8], which made [Ruby on Rails][9] famous. Maybe one day Taunus will be famous too.\n\n    Let's also create a layout. For the purposes of making our way through this guide, it'll just be a plain JavaScript function.\n\n    ```shell\n    touch layout.js\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    'use strict';\n\n    module.exports = function (model) {\n\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ...\n\n    [1]: https://github.com/taunus/taunus-express\n    [2]: https://github.com/taunus/taunus-hapi\n    [3]: https://github.com/taunus/hapiify\n    [4]: https://github.com/taunus/taunus.bevacqua.io\n    [5]: https://github.com/ponyfoo/ponyfoo\n    [6]: http://expressjs.com\n    [7]: http://hapijs.com\n    [8]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration\n    [9]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails\n");
