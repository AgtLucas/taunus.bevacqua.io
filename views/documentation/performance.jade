    # Performance Optimization

    Given that performance is one of the core values in both Taunus and User Experience, it deserved a first-class article on the site as well.

    There's a few things to take into account when developing an application if we want to strive for performance, and this article aims to be a collection of web performance best practices along with tips on how to improve performance especifically for applications built on top of Taunus.

    # Performance Checklist

    If you haven't, you should read ["Critical Path Performance Optimization"][1] as a small guide of performance optimizations you should already be doing. The list below contains some of what's discussed in that article.

    - Move away from dedicated client-side rendering
    - Use `nginx` as a reverse proxy for your front-end servers
    - Resize and optimize images
    - Defer non-critical static asset loading
    - Inline critical CSS and JavaScript
    - Cache responses aggressively
    - Ditch large libraries and frameworks
